📊 Cricket Analytics – Web Scraping & EDA Project

This project collects data on Indian cricket players using web scraping, cleans the data, and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find useful patterns and insights.

📌 Project Overview

Collected player profile links separately from the BCCI Men’s Stats page and the BCCI Women’s Stats page

Scraped all player details such as role, batting style, bowling style, matches, runs, strike rates, etc.

Combined (merged) both men’s and women’s datasets into one unified dataset

Added engineered columns (batting averages, bowling metrics, career span, strike-rate groups, role categories) to observe better insights

Cleaned and prepared the merged dataset

Performed EDA with visualizations on roles, gender representation, averages, and performance trends

📈 Key Insights

Men and women show different statistical distributions

Engineered features helped reveal deeper insights into performance

Career spans and match counts highlight useful trends across categories
